In September 2016 we reported that [the number of asylum seeking children in the care of English councils has risen 62% in a year](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-36714617).

The data came from a series of Freedom of Information requests sent by data journalist Dan Wainwright, who then spoke to the Home Office, academic experts on migration, the [Refugee Council](http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/about_refugee_council), thinktank [Migration Watch UK](http://www.migrationwatchuk.org/about-us), Kent County Council and Northamptonshire County Council. The story was also fleshed out with a video interview with Bilal, who arrived from Afghanistan as an unaccompanied child, aged 15.
